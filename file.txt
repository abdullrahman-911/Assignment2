Q1:fork() creates a new process (child) by duplicating the existing process (parent).
In the parent process, fork() returns the PID (Process ID) of the child.

In the child process, fork() returns 0.

If fork() fails, it returns -1.

the second exercise
sleep 300 & starts a process in the background
jobs lists the running processes in the background
ps aux | grep sleep finds the processes with sleep
kill PID stop a process
kill -STOP PID pause a process
kill -CONT PID resume the process

The 3rd exercise
the linker two files  file1.c file2.c 
file1.c have a function and file2.c declare that function in the main
the program returns 0 after it ends
the compile the files from .c to .o
finlly link them and make a output_program

the 4th exercise
when we run the output_program the loader copy it to the ram and excute the program at the main address

Q2: the job of the Linker is :
The linker is a crucial tool in the software development process that combines various compiled object files into a single executable program. Its main job is to ensure that all the separate pieces of code and data in a program are correctly connected and able to work together

Q3: the job of loader:
Load the executable file into memory.

Allocate memory for the code, data, stack, and heap.

Relocate addresses to adjust relative references to actual memory locations.

Link dynamic libraries and resolve references to functions/variables in them.

Finally the loader transfers control to the program’s entry point (typically the main() function), and the program begins execution.
